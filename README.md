# nn_no_libs
Trying to build a Neural network without pytorch, tensorflow, etc

 I don't know if i'll get to the end of this, but I understand how nn's work and I can implement them using libs... but that's not very fun and that
 doesn't give me a truly deep understanding. I know how to do all the math involved with nn's and I know their structure, so I should be able to build
 one from the ground up... It will be my programming that will let me down. Hopefully I can do, will be thinking about it for the next few weeks.
